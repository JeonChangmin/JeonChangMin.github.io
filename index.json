To compensate for this limited sensor data, we propose a method to generate sensor data in a virtual world and perform activity recognition through it. We generate virtual sensor data through Unity, and by applying data augmentation techniques based on motion capture data, we can collect data from various environments. As a result, we improved the performance of Activity Recognition by supplementing the existing limited dataset.\nMy Role I worked on this project as a co-lead. I was responsible for every step, including generating virtual sensor data, building an activity recognition pipeline, and collecting real-world IMU data.\nAccomplishments: Experienced materializing, implementing, and validating ideas through thought and experimentation. Implemented virtual motion synthesis with Unity.

Existing mobile deep learning frameworks such as TFLite focus on single DNN inference and thus cannot fully handle multi-DNN workloads with heterogeneous processors. Moreover, the limited operator support of different accelerators further complicates the problem. Band tackles this challenge by partitioning DNNs into subgraphs, dynamically selecting optimal schedules, and considering fallback operators for unsupported processors. Evaluation results show that Band outperforms TensorFlow Lite by up to 5.04× for single-app multi-DNN workloads and achieves a 3.76× higher satisfaction rate for latency-critical multi-app scenarios.\nWith novel findings and extensive evaluation, Band was published in MobiSys 2022.\nMy Role Our team consisted of 5 people, and we implemented and evaluated the entire platform together. Furthermore, I designed and implemented the subgraph partitioning algorithm, which is the core concept of Band.\nAccomplishments: Implemented Band in a 5-person team and experienced collaboration, including code review and testing Implemented Band based on well-organized TensorFlow Lite C++ code, increasing my understanding of system design and C++-based development Designed and implemented techniques based on system profiling Gained an understanding of accelerator APIs such as OpenCL and NNAPI while implementing a platform that supports heterogeneous processors ","date":1656288000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1656288000,"objectID":"1c0f9279892afef2ea3d24a3cd254811","permalink":"https://changminjeon.com/project/band/","publishdate":"2022-06-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/band/","section":"project","summary":"Multi-DNN inference framework for heterogeneous mobile processors with subgraph-level scheduling","tags":["On-Device AI"],"title":"Band","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Summary Mondrian is an edge system that enables high-performance object detection on high-resolution video streams. Different objects have highly diverse object detection difficulties within a single image due to their varying appearance. Still, existing edge video analytics systems are limited to extracting ROIs (Region of Interest). Mondrian not only extracts ROI regions but also reduces the amount of computation through ROI scaling according to each ROI’s difficulty and effectively performs object detection through Packed Inference with varying ROI sizes. Mondrian achieves 2.5 times higher throughput through its compressive packed inference technique than SOTA edge video analytics systems.\nMy Role As the team lead, I am responsible for all aspects.
